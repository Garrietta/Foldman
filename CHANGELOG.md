# Changelog

All notable changes to Foldman. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org); downloads are on the [releases page](https://github.com/deveshrai/Foldman/releases).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-10-21

### Fixed
- **Apple Music showed the next song instead of the one playing.** MusicKit lists only the songs *after* the current one in its queue, and Foldman read the playing song's position from that list. The title, artist, cassette label and cover now come from the song that's actually playing, and the queue and Up next start from it.
- **"Track 0 of N"** for Apple Music now shows the right position and count, including songs already played.

### Changed
- Apple Music playlists always play in order: Foldman explicitly turns shuffle off when it loads one, and turns it off again if Apple's player ever reports it on.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-21

The first release.

### Added
- **Three postures.** On the cover screen, an edge-to-edge upright portable player with the tape on end behind a window and the keys down a silver side strip. Unfolded, the same player laid down as a deck between a library panel and a now-playing panel. Half-open on a table (Flex mode), the deck on the top half and the library on the bottom.
- **The mechanism.** Latching PLAY, PAUSE, STOP·EJECT, FF and REW keys and AMS skip buttons. Reels turn at tape speed ÷ radius with spin-up and coast-down. A mechanical tape counter, VU needles that follow the real audio on local files, an OPERATE LED, synthesised key clicks and haptics, and CLICK / HAPTIC switches.
- **Local folders.** Media3 playback in a background service with media controls. Album art comes from embedded art or a cover image in the folder, and each sub-folder is listed as an album.
- **Apple Music via MusicKit** (optional AARs). Sign-in, library playlist browsing through the Apple Music API, and in-app streaming in a separate, crash-isolated process that resumes the song after a crash.
- **YT Music and Apple Music via media sessions.** Transport, artwork and queue, using notification access.
- Adaptive launcher icon with a themed (monochrome) layer.
